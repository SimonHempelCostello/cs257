DATA: 300,000 tweets from bot accounts.

FEATURES CURRENTLY WORKING:
- Graph of follower count over time for any bot account (acsess through the results of rank or search page)
- Search: searches the contents of tweets for matching strings and displays the first few results
- Rank: ranks the most sucsessful bots
- I'm Feeling luckey - take a random archeived tweet then diplays the results in a form ment to mirror the twitter interface.

FEATURES NOT YET WORKING:
- search and ranking filters have graphical elements but do not effect the SQL calls
    - This means that date filters, assending/decending sort, number of results, etc. don't function
- Most buttons on website do not interact when hovered over.
